# Redpen handbook

The user guide. It grows with the app: each module adds the pages for what you can now do, and
every example in it has been run.

## Version 0.1.0

Building from source (see `README.md`) gives:

- a tray icon with one menu item, **Quit**; no window is shown yet;
- the `redpen` command-line tool, which checks a text on this computer (below), answers
  `redpen --version --json` with `{"name":"redpen","version":"0.1.0"}`, and refuses an unknown
  argument with `error: unknown argument <arg>. Run redpen --help.`

## Checking a text on this computer

Redpen checks English with Harper, a grammar checker that runs on this computer: no account, no
key, no connection, and nothing leaves the computer. Until the popup arrives, the command-line
tool shows what a check finds. Save a text in a UTF-8 file, then:

```sh
redpen check note.txt
```

(from a source checkout: `cargo run -q -p redpen-cli -- check note.txt`). For a `note.txt` that
holds `I saw teh cat.` it prints one line of JSON, shown here spread out:

```json
{"findings": [{"id": "6-9-spelling-57a49948", "category": "spelling", "harper_kind": "Typo",
  "message": "Did you mean the definite article?",
  "span": {"chars": [6, 9], "bytes": [6, 9], "utf16": [6, 9]},
  "suggestions": [{"kind": "replace", "text": "the"}]}]}
```

Each finding has:

- a **category**, one of four (table below), and Harper's own name for the kind of problem;
- Harper's **message**;
- **suggestions**, each a `replace` (put the text in place of the span), a `remove` (delete the
  span) or an `insert_after` (add the text just after the span);
- the **span** it covers, counted three ways: in characters, in UTF-8 bytes, and in UTF-16 units
  (what JavaScript counts). An emoji such as a thumbs-up is one character, four bytes and two
  UTF-16 units, so the three can differ;
- an **id** made of the span, the category and a short fingerprint of the text under the span.

`redpen fix-all note.txt` applies the first suggestion of every finding, checks the result again,
and repeats until nothing is left to fix (at most 10 rounds). For the note above it prints
`{"text":"I saw the cat."}`. The fixes never take a text past 20,000 characters: a round that
would is left out and the text from before it is printed, so the result can always be checked
again.

**Dialects.** `--dialect` chooses the English the text is checked against: `american` (the
default), `british`, `australian`, `canadian` or `indian`, the five Harper offers. With
`--dialect british`, `The colour of the sky is blue.` has no findings; with `american`, `colour`
is a spelling finding with `color` first. The app will start from your computer's language
setting (English for the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, Canada or India gives that
dialect; any other setting gives American) and let you change it in Settings.

**Turning a category off.** `--disable spelling` (repeat it for more) drops that category's
findings and keeps the others. `redpen check --disable spelling note.txt` prints
`{"findings":[]}`.

**Categories.** Harper names more than twenty kinds of problem; Redpen groups them into four:

| Category | Harper kinds |
|---|---|
| Spelling | Spelling, Typo, BoundaryError |
| Grammar | Agreement, Grammar, WordOrder, Usage, Nonstandard, Malapropism, Eggcorn, Repetition, Miscellaneous |
| Punctuation | Punctuation, Capitalization, Formatting |
| Style | Style, WordChoice, Redundancy, Readability, Enhancement, Regionalism |

Miscellaneous holds corrections such as "a" or "an", so it counts as Grammar; Capitalization and
Formatting sit with Punctuation as the mechanics of the text.

**Limits and messages.**

- A text over 20,000 characters is not checked: "This selection is too long to check (over
  20,000 characters). Select less text." The command-line tool prints it as
  `{"error":{"kind":"TooLong","message":"…","chars":20001}}` and exits with code 2.
- Applying one fix at a time comes with the popup. A fix whose text has changed since the check
  is refused with "That suggestion no longer fits the text. Check again.", and a fix that is no
  longer offered with "That suggestion is not available any more."
- An empty file has no findings: `{"findings":[]}`.
